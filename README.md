This is **NOT** my code.

Years ago I met a younger apiring coder who was writing a game in Java.  I was impressed with his initiative and helped him make the code portable, run as a JAR and run using webstart.  I showed him how to use an IDE, source control and add unit-tests.

As I recall, he later rewrote it for Android, with improved code.

It's funny, at the time I thought I was a mentor and even began teaching him simple design patterns.  I cringe when I read my own code from that time period.
